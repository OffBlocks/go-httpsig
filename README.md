## Introduction

`httpsig` provides support for signing and verifying HTTP requests according
to the [HTTP Message Signatures][msgsig] draft standard. This standard focuses
on signing headers and request paths, and you probably want to sign the
request body too, so body digest calculation according to
[Digest Headers][dighdr] is included.

Signed HTTP requests are ideal for scenarios like sending webhooks, allowing
recievers to securely verify the request came from your server, mitigate replay
attacks, etc.

Contrary to the commonly-used `x-hub-signature`, The standards implemented by
this package provide a signature of the entire request, including HTTP headers
and the request path.

## Usage

### Signing HTTP Requests in Clients

To sign HTTP requests from a client, wrap an `http.Client`'s transport with
`NewSignTransport`:

```go
client := http.Client{
	// Wrap the transport:
	Transport: httpsig.NewSignTransport(http.DefaultTransport,
		httpsig.WithSignEcdsaP256Sha256("key1", privKey)),
}

var buf bytes.Buffer

// construct body, etc
// ...

resp, err := client.Post("https://some-url.com", "application/json", &buf)
if err != nil {
	return
}
defer resp.Body.Close()

// ...
```

### Verifying HTTP Requests in Servers

To verify HTTP requests on the server, wrap the `http.Handler`s you wish to
protect with `NewVerifyMiddleware`. `NewVerifyMiddleware` returns the wrapping
func, so you can reuse configuration across multiple handlers.

```go
h := http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/plain")
	io.WriteString(w, "Your request has an valid signature!")
})

middleware := httpsig.NewVerifyMiddleware(httpsig.WithVerifyEcdsaP256Sha256("key1", pubkey))
http.Handle("/", middleware(h))
```

## The Big Feature Matrix

This implementation is based on version `06` of [HTTP Message Signatures][msgsig]
(`draft-ietf-htttpbis-message-signatures-05` from 8 June 2021). Digest
computation is based on version `05` of [Digest Headers][dighdr]
(`draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers-05` from 13 April 2021).
